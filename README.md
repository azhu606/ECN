whats up team.
in case u need a refresher:
1. To run the frontend locally, first clone the repo by doing: git clone https://github.com/azhu606/ECN
2. then cd into the folder, wherever u put it

NOT working yet:
3. once ur in the folder do : npm install
4. then do npm run dev and the website should be up and running

raghav can u figure out wtf i did wrong
